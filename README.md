# fs-finder

File system finder inspired by finder in [Nette framework](http://doc.nette.org/en/finder).

## Installing

```
$ npm install fs-finder
```

## Searching

There are two ways of searching for files or directories: `synchronous` and `asynchronous`.

### Synchronous

#### Searching files in directory

```
var Finder = require('fs-finder');

var files = Finder.in('/var/data/base-path').findFiles();		// returns array with file's names
```

#### Searching directories

```
var directories = Finder.in(baseDir).findDirectories();		// returns array with directories's names
```

#### Searching for files and directories

```
var paths = Finder.in(baseDir).find();		// returns array with file's and directories's names
```

### Asynchronous

If `fs-finder` find callback in find* methods, it will automatically use asynchronous searching.

#### Searching files in directory

```
Finder.in('/var/data/base-path').findFiles(function(files) {
	console.log(files);
});
```

#### Searching directories

```
Finder.in(baseDir).findDirectories(function(directories) {
	console.log(directories);
});
```

#### Searching for files and directories

```
var paths = Finder.in(baseDir).find(function(paths) {
	console.log(paths);
});
```

## Recursive searching

```
var paths = Finder.from(baseDir).find();
```

## Path mask

```
var files = Finder.from(baseDir).findFiles('*.coffee');
```

or asynchronous:
```
Finder.from(baseDir).findFiles('*.coffee', function(files) {
	// do something with given list of files
});
```

In this example fs finder looks for all files in base directories recursively with '.coffee' in their name.
Asterisk is just shortcut for regexp '[0-9a-zA-Z/.-_ ]+' so you can also use regexp in mask.

Only thing what you have to do, is enclose your regex into <>.

```
var files = Finder.from(baseDir).findFiles('temp/<[0-9]+>.tmp');		// files in temp directories with numbers in name and .tmp extension
```

## Excluding

Same technique like path mask works also for excluding files or directories.

```
var files = Finder.from(baseDir).exclude(['/.git']).findFiles();
```

This code will return all files from base directory but not files beginning with .git or in .git directory.
Also there you can use regular expressions or asterisk.

## Filters

### Filtering by file size

```
var files = Finder.from(baseDir).size('>=', 450).size('<=' 500).findFiles();
```

Returns all files with size between 450B and 500B.

### Filtering by modification date

```
var files = Finder.from(baseDir).date('>', {minutes: 10}).date('<', {minutes: 1}).findFiles();
```

Returns all files which were modified between two and nine minutes ago.
Date filter expecting literal object (you can see documentation in moment.js [documentation](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/))
or string date representation in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm format.

### Custom filters

```
var filter = function(stat, path) {
	if ((new Date).getMinutes() === 42) {
		return true;
	} else {
		return false;
	}
});

var files = Finder.from(baseDir).filter(filter).findFiles();
```

Returns all files if actual time is any hour with 42 minutes.
Custom filters are anonymous function with stat file object parameter ([documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats))
and file name.

## System and temp files

In default, fs-finder ignoring temp and system files, which are created for example by gedit editor and which have got ~ character
in the end of file name or dot in the beginning.

```
var files = Finder.in(dir).showSystemFiles().findFiles()
```

## Look in parent directories

Finder can also look for files in parent directories. There is used `exclude` method, so directories in which were your
files already searched, will not be opened for searching again in their next parent directory if you are using `from` method.

Keep in mind that one of parent directories is also your disk root directory, so you can get list of all of your files or
 directories on disk which are accessible from your user account. To avoid this, you can set depth.

```
var files = Finder.in(dir).lookUp().findFiles('5.log');

// set depth with number of parent directories
var files = Finder.in(dir).lookUp(3).findFiles('5.log');

// set depth with path to top directory
var files = Finder.in(dir).lookUp('/var/stop/here').findFiles('5.log');
```

## Find first

When you want to find first occur of some file or directory, you can use option `findFirst`. fs-finder will not look into
all directories (for recursive searching) but stop when it will find first matching path.

If there is no matching path, null will be returned.

```
var file = Finder.from(dir).findFirst().findFiles('<[0-9]{2}>');
```

There is also shortcut:
```
var file = Finder.from(dir).findFile('<[0-9]{2}>');
```

or:
```
var directory = Finder.from(dir).findDirectory();
```

## Tests

```
$ npm test
```

If you want to use fs-finder in your own tests, you can use it with [fs-mock](https://github.com/sakren/node-fs-mock)
module, which is already build it.

For more information how to use it, please read documentation for [fs-mock](https://github.com/sakren/node-fs-mock/blob/master/README.md).

```
var fs = null;

beforeEach(function() {
	fs = Finder.mock({
		'var': {
			'www': {
				'index.php': '<?php echo "hello; ?>'
			}
		}
	});
});

afterEach(function() {
	Finder.restore();
});
```

In fs variable is now mocked fs module, so if you need to use fs module in your tests, just use this one.
